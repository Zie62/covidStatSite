This will be a covid statistics UI utilizing the Johns Hopkins covid data API through RapidAPI. Currently only have some basic proof of concept pages going on, but soon will have a functioning UI for navigating their datasets. Contains dropdowns for country (Which will autofill country ISO codes into a form) as well as other relevant data. Currently, I have the form set up and the data from a given query is put out onto the console. If you want to utilize this library, make sure to get your own API keys from RapidAPI and add them to your own .env file. Not including mine for obvious reasons. 

Utilizing React for UI and Node.js / Express.js for backend.
