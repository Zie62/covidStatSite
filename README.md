# Johns Hopkins Covid Statistics UI

This will be a covid statistics UI utilizing a Johns Hopkins covid data API (Axisbits' 'COVID-19 Statistics') through RapidAPI. Contains dropdown menus for country (Which will autofill country ISO codes into a form) as well as region, city, and date. Currently, I have the form set up and it will redirect you to a report page to give you the statistics you requested. Also has global statistics which can be found through the navigation bar. If you want to utilize this library, make sure to get your own API keys from RapidAPI and add them to your own .env file and run `npm i`, `npm run build` before using the `npm run dstart` command to run it locally. 

Utilizing React for UI and Node.js / Express.js for backend.
