This will be a covid statistics UI utilizing the Johns Hopkins covid data API through RapidAPI. Currently only have some basic proof of concept pages going on, but soon will have a functioning UI for navigating their datasets. Will contain dropdowns for country (Which will autofill country ISO codes into a form) as well as other relevant data. Currently, I have the form set up but not the actual API query for data alongside a redirect and no design has been added, only the raw form.

Utilizing React for UI and Node.js / Express.js for backend.
